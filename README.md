# TODO Web Application

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The web application provides user the ability to create TODO tasks. Then he can check/uncheck or delete the completed TODO.

I used the backend server (NodeJS) for serving data which is deployed on Heroku cloud.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

Launches the [Cypress](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/overview/why-cypress) test runner in the interactive watch mode.
